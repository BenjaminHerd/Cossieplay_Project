    <h1>We have some cool things happening that we want people to know about:</h1>
    
   <section> <p>This month you can purchase 3 drinks for the price of 2 at the bar.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>First-time party-goers get a 50% discount on entry</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you get a costume custom made, your next party entry is free if you wear that costume.
Wear your costume in to KFC on Stanton street and you can get a free drink with a 21-piece bucket. Tell them youâ€™ve been to CossiePlay!
</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>That's all for now!</p>
