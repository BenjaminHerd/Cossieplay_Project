<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>Improve business exposure and as a result, profitability off of development of website.  Therefore, the design has to draw the viewersâ€™ attention to the available services and generate exposure to the wider public in general.</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p> During a 4 month trial period, success will be evaluated by determining an increase in attendance to events, and the number of people ordering from the company.  For the events, a 50% increase to the attendance of parties by the company, as well as a 50% increase in the number of orders requested from the public.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>Mostly has been middle-aged adults between 35-50yrs, but the company wishes to branch out towards kids (6-17), teenagers and youth as well.  To accommodate this, virbrant, eye-catching colours with a contrast of light green, blue and white will provide the theme for the website, while not cramming too many colours at the same time.  </p>
